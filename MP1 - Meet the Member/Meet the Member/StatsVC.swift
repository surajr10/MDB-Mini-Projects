import UIKit

class StatsVC: UIViewController {
    
    // MARK: STEP 13: StatsVC Data
    // When we are navigating between VCs (e.g MainVC -> StatsVC),
    // since MainVC doesn't directly share its instance properties
    // with other VCs, we often need a mechanism of transferring data
    // between view controllers. There are many ways to achieve
    // this, and I will show you the two most common ones today. After
    // carefully reading these two patterns, pick one and implement
    // the data transferring for StatsVC.
    
    // Method 1: Implicit Unwrapped Instance Property
    var dataWeNeedExample1: String!
    //
    // Check didTapStats in MainVC.swift on how to use it.
    //
    // Explanation: This method is fairly straightforward: you
    // declared a property, which will then be populated after
    // the VC is instantiated. As long as you remember to
    // populate it after each instantiation, the implicit forced
    // unwrap will not result in a crash.
    //
    // Pros: Easy, no boilerplate required
    //
    // Cons: Poor readability. Imagine if another developer wants to
    // use this class, unless it's been well-documented, they would
    // have no idea that this variable needs to be populated.
    
    // Method 2: Custom initializer
    var dataWeNeedExample2: String
    init(data: String) {
        dataWeNeedExample2 = data
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }
    
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
    //
    // Check didTapStats in MainVC.swift on how to use it.
    //
    // Explanation: This method creates a custom initializer which
    // takes in the required data. This pattern results in a cleaner
    // initialization and is more readable. Compared with method 1
    // which first initialize the data to nil then populate, in this
    // method the data is directly initialized in the init so there's
    // no need for unwrapping of any kind.
    //
    // Pros: Clean. Null safe.
    //
    // Cons: Doesn't work with interface builder (storyboard)
    
    // MARK: >> Your Code Here <<
    
    // MARK: STEP 14: StatsVC UI
    // You know the drill. Initialize the UI components, add subviews,
    // and create constraints.
    //
    // Note: You cannot use self inside these closures because they
    // happens before the instance is fully initialized. If you want
    // to use self, do it in viewDidLoad.
    
    // MARK: >> Your Code Here <<
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // MARK: >> Your Code Here <<
    }
